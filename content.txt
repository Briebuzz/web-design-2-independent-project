The organization is run entirely by volunteers (who donate their time outside their work schedule and personal lives) and is 100% foster-based — all our dogs wait for their forever families in loving foster homes, where they learn to be good canine citizens.Since Rocky Road Rescue is not for profit, we raise funds through events and fundraisers, which allow us to continue to rescue dogs in need. One hundred percent of these funds go towards the purchase of food, vetting costs, shelter pull fees, and other costs associated with caring for the dogs and the general operation of the rescue. We thank you for considering adoption and supporting rescue.---What we do/* paragraph next to image */[images/_.jpg]Our goals are to rescue dogs from high-kill shelters, dogs without homes, and compassionate owner surrenders, to provide them with the medical care they deserve, as well as find them the best loving forever homes. We are also committed to educating the public on responsible pet ownership, and to give back to the community through assisting families in need whenever possible. ---How to support or join us/* cards */[icons/_.svg]Donatehttps://rockyroadrescue.com/give/ {icons/_.svg]Volunteerhttps://rockyroadrescue.com/volunteer-application/ {icons/_.svg]Fosterhttps://rockyroadrescue.com/foster-application/ ---For more information visit http://rockyroadrescue.com Instagram TwitterFacebook Donate!Rocky Road Rescue [logo.svg]Home RescueBenefits Reasons to say yes---RescueOptions	/* image dd list in grid */Puppy [images/_.jpg]Teenage dog[images/_.jpg]Senior dog[images/_.jpg]Mix breed[images/_.jpg]Pure bred[images/_.jpg]Good with cats/kids/other dogs[images/_.jpg]Disabled [images/_.jpg]Good with disabilities [images/_.jpg]First Home [images/_.jpg]Rehomed [images/_.jpg]---Happy Tails and Tales/* div image and text */NameStory[images/_.jpg]NameStory[images/_.jpg]---For more information visit http://rockyroadrescue.com Instagram TwitterFacebook Donate!Rocky Road Rescue [logo.svg]Home RescueBenefits Reasons to say yes---BenefitsFinancial Benefits/* chart */Our adoption fee is $550 for adult dogs and $650 for puppies. This includes micro-chipping, all age-appropriate vaccines at the time of adoption, as well as spay or neuter. In some cases, as with senior dogs or dogs that will have ongoing medical expenses, we waive or reduce the adoption fee. We do require references and an application to be filled out for each adoption. Male Dog under 20 kg$150Male Dog 20-40 kg$175Male Dog over 40kg$200Female Dog under 20 kg$190Female Dog 20-40 kg$215Female Dog over 40kg$250---  Emotional Benefits /* icons text list in grids */Thinking about surrendering your family pet is a tough choice. The decision is not made easily, and it is very difficult to lose a loving pet. Sometimes families have no other choice but to surrender (whether due to allergies, finances, or hitting a dead end with resources such as training), and it is a decision made with love and the best interest of their pet in mind. Potential adopters can meet the dog one-on-one with its foster and ask all the questions that come to mind! This step is about the dog’s reaction to you, of course, but most importantly is the perfect time for you to see the dog in its comfortable environment (its foster home) and the relationship the foster has been able to build with the dog.For adopters, we are always there – every step of the adoption journey, and for years afterwards! Our volunteers are here to answer and disclose all information we are aware of regarding temperament and medical needs. Not only this, but we are also here to help you do proper introductions with your other family members – furry or human! Additionally, we provide information on the adjustment period and tips to help your new furry family member adapt to your home and schedule. We can also recommend amazing trainers and veterinarians, if your rescue pooch requires any help later in life.---For more information visit http://rockyroadrescue.com Instagram TwitterFacebook Donate!---Human.txt links(help) humanstxt.orghttps://rockyroadrescue.com/about/ (org info)http://rockyroadrescue.com/adopt/ (adopt info)http://rockyroadrescue.com/surrender/(surrender info)
