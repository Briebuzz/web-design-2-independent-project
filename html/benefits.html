      <h3>Emotional Benefits</h3>
      /* icons text list in grids */
      <p>Thinking about surrendering your family pet is a tough choice. The decision is not made easily, and it is very difficult to lose a loving pet. Sometimes families have no other choice but to surrender (whether due to allergies, finances, or hitting a dead end with resources such as training), and it is a decision made with love and the best interest of their pet in mind.</p>
      <p>Potential adopters can meet the dog one-on-one with its foster and ask all the questions that come to mind! This step is about the dog’s reaction to you, of course, but most importantly is the perfect time for you to see the dog in its comfortable environment (its foster home) and the relationship the foster has been able to build with the dog.</p>
      <p>For adopters, we are always there – every step of the adoption journey, and for years afterwards! Our volunteers are here to answer and disclose all information we are aware of regarding temperament and medical needs. Not only this, but we are also here to help you do proper introductions with your other family members – furry or human!</p>
      <p>Additionally, we provide information on the adjustment period and tips to help your new furry family member adapt to your home and schedule. We can also recommend amazing trainers and veterinarians, if your rescue pooch requires any help later in life.</p>
