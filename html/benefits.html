      <h2>Financial Benefits</h2>
      <p>Our adoption fee is $550 for adult dogs and $650 for puppies. This includes micro-chipping, all age-appropriate vaccines at the time of adoption, as well as spay or neuter. In some cases, as with senior dogs or dogs that will have ongoing medical expenses, we waive or reduce the adoption fee. We do require references and an application to be filled out for each adoption.</p>

      <h2>Emotional Benefits</h2>
      <img src="../icons/surrender.svg" alt="">
      <p>Thinking about surrendering your family pet is a tough choice. The decision is not made easily, and it is very difficult to lose a loving pet. Sometimes families have no other choice but to surrender (whether due to allergies, finances, or hitting a dead end with resources such as training), and it is a decision made with love and the best interest of their pet in mind.</p>
      <img src="../icons/agree.svg" alt="">
      <p>Potential adopters can meet the dog one-on-one with its foster and ask all the questions that come to mind! This step is about the dog’s reaction to you, of course, but most importantly is the perfect time for you to see the dog in its comfortable environment (its foster home) and the relationship the foster has been able to build with the dog.</p>
      <img src="../icons/health.svg" alt="">
      <p>For adopters, we are always there – every step of the adoption journey, and for years afterwards! Our volunteers are here to answer and disclose all information we are aware of regarding temperament and medical needs. Not only this, but we are also here to help you do proper introductions with your other family members – furry or human!</p>
      <img src="../icons/celebrate.svg" alt="">
      <p>Additionally, we provide information on the adjustment period and tips to help your new furry family member adapt to your home and schedule. We can also recommend amazing trainers and veterinarians, if your rescue pooch requires any help later in life.</p>
